# lightning-presentations
A place to stash Lightning Talk-style presentations

I intend to write a few of these of my own, but some of these are taken from elsewhere.

My personal favorite so far is Publish Your Crappy Script by Jonathan Simpson, which I have added to this repository.
It was originally found here:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_AQWwRYar7Rul32vpXiZ1c8sTsKCQoouMsdjEZuELFo/edit#slide=id.g2514def90e_11_0
by way of here:
https://twitter.com/jonathand82/status/902610258350284800
...but we'd all forget how to find it if we only saw it on Twitter, right?

That presentation also inspired my choice of license for this repository.
